Hi [Hiring Manager Name],

I built an interactive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to showcase my qualifications for the AI PM role - demonstrating both technical understanding and product thinking.

**üîó Explore my experience**: https://github.com/rishia/rishi-resume-mcp

**Highlights:**
- Natural language queries about my experience
- Features my ML underwriting model (92% accuracy) at Justworks
- $29M+ quantifiable revenue impact across roles
- Built-in evaluation suite with test cases
- Multiple deployment options for easy access

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone and run the interactive demo
git clone https://github.com/rishia/rishi-resume-mcp.git
cd rishi-resume-mcp
python quickstart.py
```

The README includes sample questions to explore my AI/ML experience, business impact, and domain expertise.

Looking forward to discussing how my experience building AI-powered products in regulated industries aligns with your team's needs.
